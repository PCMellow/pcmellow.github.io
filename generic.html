									<li><i>I have worked as a <b> Volunteer Data Analyst</b> during the COVID 19 vaccination drive for my locality.
									We were to entry, work and provide recommendations with the data.
								<br><br>We were to look through the stored data, <b>check for its integrity, its reliability and then used it for getting needed insights.</b> For example,like for the total number of people to be vaccinated in a certain day, the number of people who were to be vaccinated according to thier age, people who have pre-exisiting medical conditions and get certain medications for them, total number of Blood test tubes or 'vials' available and accordingly increase/decrease its order etc.
								<br><br>
								<li><i>I have worked as a <b>Tutor</b>, after completing my Bachelor's, teaching Physics to some of my neighbours and relatives to prepare them for their High School Examination.
